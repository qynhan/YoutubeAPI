## Program Overview
When watching videos from a playlist, sometimes it would be beneficial to know how long it would take me to watch the entire playlist, but currently, there isn't a feature on YouTube that would do the calculations.

Additionally, I would like to find out the most popular videos in a given playlist.

I created a tool that calculates the total video length in a given playlist and also the most popular

# Run instructions
By running `python3 main.py`, the program will output the sum video length of the given playlist.

By running `python3 mostPopular.py`, the program will output the links and view count of the ten most popular videos in the given playlist.
